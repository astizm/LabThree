Lab Three - 17/03

This Lab took me a while to get functioning as required. I did a fair bit of reading on the SDV503 git book chapters (Kahwaji, 2020) around switch 
statements to try and figure out how to get the switch and if statements to co-operate. In the end, it was practicing, trial and error, and knowledge 
from the support people around me - my tutors and class mates - that helped me to write it cohesively and create the end result in index.js.

I know now that I'm confident in writing a switch statement and the structure required for a switch statement, as well as what it's uses are for adding 
additional context to any given value. 
This would include creating a variable for the switch statement to compare, ensuring breaks between cases so that JS stops executing the code and
ensuring a default output if the variable does not match any given case. This is outlined in the example code from the SDV503 book below.

I still have a lot to learn but I am becoming more confident in my abilities to understand the concepts required. All of the concepts I've learned so far
will be valuable for my career prospects as well as future assessments for SDV503.







---------example code------------

const person = 'Joe';
switch (person) {
  case 'Jane':
    console.log('Hi Jane');
    break;
  case 'John':
    console.log('Hi John');
    break;
  case 'Joe':
    console.log('Hi Joe');
    break;
  case 'Mary':
    console.log('Hi Mary');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('Hi');
    break;
}


----------practice code----------
//const gradeM = (grade) => grade
/*function returns the grade output but not grade description.

Not sure how to introduce the switch statement at this point.
As from earlier lesson introducing a new variable to create another parameter confuses the switch statement

** Added (grade) to switch console.log
**introducing a new variable for the switch statement
(returns the value for grade instead of the string value, unable to link cases to 'if' parameters)
let gradeD = grade 
const gradeM = (grade, gradeD) => grade + gradeD
if (grade >= 85 && grade <= 100) {
    console.log(grade + ", A+")                                                      99, A+
switch (gradeD) {
    case grade + ", A+":
        console.log(grade + " Pass with Distinction")                                (default "Please enter a percentage...")
        
        console.log(gradeM(grade))                                                   NaN

   >>> Not what we want.   

**Putting the switch statement within the function returns undefined
const gradeM = (grade) => {switch (grade) {
    case "A+":
    case "A":
    case "A-":
        console.log(grade + " Pass with Distinction"); //description for grades A- to A+ with grade
        break;
      case "B+":
        case "B":
        case "B-":
            console.log(grade + " Pass with Merit"); //description for grades B- to B+ with grade
            break;
        case "C+":
        case "C":
            console.log(grade + " Pass") //description for grades C - C+ with grade
            break;
        case "D":
        case "E":
            console.log(grade + " Fail")//description for grades D & E with grade
            break;
        default:
            console.log("Please enter percentage..") //default value
            break;}
    }
