# LabThree
fun times
I haven't been able to create and execute a working code block for LabThree (even outside the time frame and with help)
I can't seem to make a switch block work in a way with the if/else statements that creates what was asked of me, I'm sure I'm missing something really simple but I can't find an answer. On top of that my moodle won't log in from home.
Today is not the best day..
